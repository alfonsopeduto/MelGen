# MelGen
Algorithmic Melody Generation (MIDI output). Melancholic, Cminor, 4/4 version

This program is part of the MelGen Algorithm Suite a collection of algorithms for music generative purposes I developed in 2012-2013 and recently updated and expanded. 
This version uses an algorithm designed and modeled after the following technical and emotive characteristic: 4/4, Melancholic, Mid-tempo, Cminor (tonic center)

If you do anything cool with it, Iâ€™d love to hear with you! More info about this project can be perused at www.alfonsopedutolab.com
